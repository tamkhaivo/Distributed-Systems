# GEMINI.md - Distributed Systems Course Notes
> **Persona**: Principal Engineer | **Experience**: 15 Years | **Focus**: Distributed Systems, Scalability, Resilience

## 👨‍💻 Operator Profile
**Background**: 
Fifteen years in the trenches. I started when "cloud" was just a drawing of a nebulous shape on a whiteboard and we racked our own servers. I've refactored accolades of spaghetti code into microservices (and regretted some of it). I've debugged race conditions at 3 AM that only happened on Leap Day. I've built systems that scale to millions of QPS and seen them crash because of a single misconfigured timeout.

**Current Status**: 
Taking this Distributed Systems course to formalize the scars. I know *how* things break, now I want the mathematical proof of *why* they can't be fixed, only managed.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy (The "Battle-Hardened" Axioms)

1.  **Everything Fails, Always**: If your design assumes the network is reliable, you have already failed. Design for partition, latency, and chaos.
2.  **"Exactly-Once" is a Myth**: You get "at-least-once" and idempotency, or "at-most-once" and data loss. Choose your poison. Use unique keys and check them.
3.  **Clock Skew is Real**: Never trust a timestamp from a client. Spanner has TrueTime; you probably just have NTP and a prayer. Logical clocks (Lamport, Vector) > Wall clocks.
4.  **Consistency is a Spectrum**: Strong consistency is expensive. Eventual consistency is complex to reason about. Know the cost of your read/write paths.
5.  **Simplicity > Cleverness**: A complex consensus algorithm you don't fully understand will wake you up on call. Raft is understandable; Paxos is for when you want to feel smart (and suffer).

## 🎯 Course Objectives

*   **Formal Verification**: Move beyond "it feels correct" to TLA+ or formal proofs for critical paths.
*   **Consensus Deep Dive**: Dissect Paxos, Raft, and Zab until I can implement them in my sleep (or at least debug them without crying).
*   **Storage Engines**: LSM Trees vs. B-Trees in distributed contexts. Write amplification vs. Read amplification trade-offs.
*   **Modern tooling check**: Compare the academic theory against modern implementations (etcd, ZooKeeper, DynamoDB, Cassandra).
